Hairstyle - long enough to run a comb through, usually let it grow for 1.5 months then cut back.The Biotin B-Complex conditioner is a daily counterbalance to the Biotin Shampoo. The Shampoo is harsh but effective. It leaves my hair feeling like a brillo pad and the conditioner helps break that apart. When used together the signs of balding are significantly reduced (seeing your scalp through the hair). Also, my hairstyle is a lot easier and fuller looking (messy and pushed up in the front).Even with the combination I found my hair needing a break from the two. I use Organix Coconut milk conditioner once a week to soften my hair. This is an extremely effective break.The proportions I use suit my taste. The appearance of thickness is all I really care about.

I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.**IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER, I'M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS.  My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements. I use the supplements in place of a multi so I also take OMEGA 3 & Calcium Citrate w/ D3. (As per Dr).**6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth, I've noticed that I'M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash & style!  It's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, I'll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - Could it be?  New hair?  Will keep you posted.  I see three short hairs poking through!  I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  I suspect this would be from the internal good I'm getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.7/21/2013 - YES!  Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots.  My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy; it looks!  I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner.  It's stripping the oils from my hair.  I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  WIll keep updating.  I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!  That is the good part!  SO, I will be using the MAXI HAIR daily as bottle recommends, but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Losing less hair!

I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Industrial strength degreaser. \"Fullness\" is caused by stripping oils and making hair fluffy", "unixReviewTime": 1401840000, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2014"}

I have a variety of liquids in it, and two are actually very thick. I had no problem priming the thing and getting it going, so even the thick stuff pumps out smoothly, without any issues. As far as mounting goes, the silicon they provided was hardened and fairly useless, only got a little bit out. Luckily, I had a tube of rubber adhesive (similar to the silicon, but a bit thinner), which worked fine to attach the plastic base of the unit to the uneven ceramic tile of my shower wall. It is on there solid, and not going anywhere. I have used the silicon type adhesive with another product (aDeluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall. 20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.I ordered here on amazon) and it works equally well. Of course they have not been time-tested, but this method is a heck of a lot better then suction cups. In terms of getting the things off when/if the time comes, I can't help ya there, but others in these reviews have mentioned product that can clean off the adhesive residue from tile. If I have to take these down at some point, it will probably be just to replace them. I am not renting, so I don't have to worry about that.I was pleasantly surprised to find the claims about saving soap/shampoo to be very true. I use a lot less with this dispenser then when squirting directly from the bottle. A few pumps get you going, then an occasional pump to keep the lather going. It's much easier to control, because less comes out with each pump of the dispenser, but I want to emphasize, it is in NO WAY inconvenient or difficult to get enough soap out with quickly with a few pumps-- faster then messing with the bottles themselves or with bar soap for that matter.I got the white plastic, which I am sure will discolor over time, as does almost all white plastic-- but that is just a guess, and I don't really care.I give it 4 our of 5 because of the silicon issue (and if I didn't have any lying around the house, and had to order some more and wait on it, I might have been irritated enough to bump another star-- but that would be unfortunate, because it really is a great product, even if you need to order your own adhesive).Conclusion: highly recommend, no reservations!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works great.", "unixReviewTime": 1321142400, "reviewTime": "11 13, 2011"}

The tip does not get very hot at all.Heating is very quick, about a minute, and it has a simple rotary knob built into the handle to adjust the heat.  The controls are near where some people may hold the barrel, so you could accidentally touch them, but I think the barrel design makes it simple enough to avoid that (the rotary switch is on a thicker barrel part, adjacent to the heating iron.

I've used every concealer out there, but most only further exaggerate the dark circles and worsen the appearance of bags.  The good thing about this concealer is that it's extremely affordable and the yellow really does help neutralize the appearance of blue and purple veins under the eyes.  The bad news is that it appears cakey when applied under powdered mineral makeup, giving a chalk-like appearance.  This occurs even when the concealer is applied VERY lightly.  If you use a liquid makeup, this will probably not be an issue.  With other forms of makeup, it might not blend as well as you would like.  I still find it does a better job than the other concealers, so I still use a small amount of this and take some considerable time blending it with my foundation.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Decent for Covering Dark Circles, but Doesn't Work Well under Powdered Makeup.", "unixReviewTime": 1375315200, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2013"}
